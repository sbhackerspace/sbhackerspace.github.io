# Santa Barbara Hackerspace: Building the Future of Making in Goleta

2025 has been a year of big changes and bigger plans for Santa Barbara Hackerspace.  
As many of you know, we’ve moved into our new home at **302 Pine Ave, Goleta**. This new space marks the next chapter in our mission: to create a vibrant, accessible workshop and community hub for makers, tinkerers, artists, and inventors of all ages.

## Why We Moved
Our old space served us well for years, but the building sold in April and the new management set rent prices above what we could reasonably afford. The good news is the new Pine Ave location gives us:

- **More square footage** for tools and equipment (~3,700sq/ft => ~5,000sq/ft)
- Dedicated rooms for electronics, wood, and metal work
- A larger community classroom and dedicated meeting area
- Future capacity for even more tools

It’s a blank canvas, and we’re already turning it into something amazing.

## What We’re Working On
Since moving in, we’ve been:

- Designing safe, accessible workspaces
- Planning **public classes and workshops** that anyone can attend
- Laying out zones for robotics, electronics, woodshop, metal fabrication, textiles, and more

## Why It Matters
Santa Barbara Hackerspace is more than a workshop.  
We’re a **community resource** where people can:

- **Learn** hands-on skills
- **Share** knowledge and collaborate
- **Build** prototypes, projects, and ideas that otherwise wouldn’t leave the napkin

Makerspaces like ours help bridge the gap between ideas and real-world impact. Whether you’re a high school student wanting to learn soldering, an entrepreneur building a prototype, or a hobbyist perfecting a passion project, this is your space.

## How You Can Help
We’re a non-profit and run almost entirely on member dues and donations. Right now, our biggest needs are:

- **Funding** for tools, safety equipment, and infrastructure [Donate Here](https://store.sbhackerspace.com)
- **Volunteers** to help set up the new space
- **Community** support to spread the word

If you’d like to contribute - financially, with tools, or with your time—please reach out to us. Every bit helps.

## What’s Next
Our immediate goals for the rest of 2025:

- Complete unpacking and tool setup
- Host a 15th anniversary / grand opening party in mid August
- Open the doors wide to new and current members

We’re building something that will serve Santa Barbara and Goleta for years to come. The energy and creativity in this community is unmatched, and with your support, this new hackerspace will become a hub for it all.
